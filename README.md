# Convert Phone Number to Words

Given a 10 digit phone number, you should return all possible words or combinations of words from the provided dictionary, that can be mapped back as a whole to the number.

With this we can generate numbers like 1-800-motortruck which is easier to remember than 1-800-6686787825.

The phone number mapping to letters is as follows:

2 = a b c
3 = d e f
4 = g h i
5 = j k l
6 = m n o
7 = p q r s
8 = t u v
9 = w x y z

The phone numbers will never contain a 0 or 1. Words have to be at least 3 characters.

To give you an initial idea, here are some numbers that return (a lot of) results.

6686787825 returns a (long) list with at least these word combinations:

motortruck
motor, truck
motor, usual
noun, struck
